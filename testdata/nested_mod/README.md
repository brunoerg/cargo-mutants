# `nested_mod` testdata tree

This tree contains many nested modules from both toplevel files (lib.rs and main.rs) to exercise the module file discovery mechanism.

The module names are descriptive where necessary (e.g. `c_file` is a file) and short where details are not needed (e.g. `a`, `b` for simple nesting).
