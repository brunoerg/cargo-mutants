# Welcome to cargo-mutants

cargo-mutants is a mutation testing tool for Rust. It helps you improve your
program's quality by finding places where bugs can be inserted without
causing any tests to fail.

**The goal of cargo-mutants is to be _easy_ to run on any Rust source tree, and
to tell you something _interesting_ about areas where bugs might be lurking or
the tests might be insufficient.** ([More about these goals](goals.md).)

To get started:

1. [Install cargo-mutants](installation.md).
2. [Run `cargo mutants`](getting-started.md) in your Rust source tree.
