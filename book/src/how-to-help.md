# How to help

Experience reports in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants/discussions) or issues are very welcome:

- Did it find a bug or important coverage gap?
- Did it fail to build and test your tree? (Some cases that aren't supported yet
  are already listed in this doc or the bug tracker.)

It's especially helpful if you can either point to an open source tree that will
reproduce the problem (or success) or at least describe how to reproduce it.

If you are interested in contributing a patch, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
